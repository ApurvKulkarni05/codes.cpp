hello connections , 
now let us talk about longest valid parenthesis problem which another important problem 

i used this approach=>
Initialize a stack and push -1 as a base index to handle edge cases.

Iterate through the string:

If you encounter '(', push its index to the stack.

If you encounter ')', pop the top:

If the stack becomes empty, push the current index as a new base.
Else, update the max valid length as the difference between current index and the index at the top of the stack.

Return the maximum length found.
most important differnce betwen valid parenthesis and longest valid parenthesis will be in valid uestion we want to check entire string is valid or not
and in longest valid parenthesis we want to check one string contain one substring
